# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project! ‚ù§Ô∏è

At this time, I am not accepting pull requests or external code contributions.  
The project is maintained by its author (me), and changes are made internally.

If you find a bug, have a question, or would like to suggest an improvement, please feel free to [open an issue](../../issues).


## Why no pull requests?

This is a personal project that I maintain in my free time.  
Keeping development limited to internal changes allows me to work on it at my own pace, without the pressure of reviewing and merging external contributions. This helps me keep the project enjoyable and sustainable in the long run.

Thank you for your understanding. üôè
