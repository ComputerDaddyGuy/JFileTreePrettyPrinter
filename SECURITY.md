## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, please **open a private security advisory** through the GitHub interface:

Alternatively, you may open a regular [issue](../../issues) if the problem is not sensitive.

⚠️ There is no guarantee that every report will be reviewed or fixed.

⚠️ Please do not send reports by email.  
This project is maintained in free time, so response times may vary.
